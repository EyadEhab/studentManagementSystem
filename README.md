Our group project was about student managment system,we used Github for our team collabiration,when you run our application you will notice that there will be a pop up page asking for your user id and password and there will be two buttons one of them is login and the other is sign in and because it's your first time entering it you will press sign in
then enter your ID and create your own password then choose wether you are instructor or a student or even an adminstrator then press signup then close these page and open the login page and enter your ID and password then if you choose that you are a student in the sign up page there will be another page presented
asking you if you want to enroll,drop or even view your grades.If you choose to be an instructor you will notice a pop up page that asks you if you want to add a course or remove one or to update a grade by entering students id and the course name and then enter the new grade.If you choose to be an adminstrator
you will otice a diffrent page from the previous two asking if you want to add,remove course and if you want to remove a user or add one.
